# FCND - 3D Motion Planning

This project is a continuation of the Backyard Flyer project where we executed a simple square shaped flight path. In this project we will integrate the techniques that we have learned throughout the last several lessons to plan a path through an urban environment.


## Instructions:
### Step 1: Download the Simulator
This is a new simulator environment!  

Download the Motion-Planning simulator for this project that's appropriate for your operating system from the [simulator releases respository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator-Releases/releases).

### Step 2: Set up your Python Environment
If you haven't already, set up your Python environment and get all the relevant packages installed using Anaconda following instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

### Step 3: Clone this Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/houssemjebari/Udacity-FlyingCars
```

## Code Explanation:
This project is divided into two main files 'planning.py' and 'planning_utils.py'
* The first file contains a finite state machine executed with Event Driven Programming Paradigm to improve security of the drone
* The second file contains the planning functions. You can use any of the planning functions that I developed in the [Planning Folder](../Term2-Planning/) as your planner
