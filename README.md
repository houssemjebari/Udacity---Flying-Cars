Flying Cars
A flying car is a type of personal air vehicle or roadable aircraft that provides door-to-door transportation by both ground and air. 
This repository is built to showcase completed classroom projects of Flying Car Nanodegree offered by Udacity

This README is broken down into the following sections:

Building an Estimator
Backyard Flyer
Make a simulated drone fly in a square shape!

In this project, we have written the "Hello, world!" of drone programming as we write event-driven code that causes a quadrotor to take off, fly in a square, and land.

This project is the first project of Flying Car Nanodegree as an exercise of Introduction to Autonomous Flight section of the program.You can find more information about the implementation steps of this project on the project's own README file. Also, You can visit the project's original repository for further information.

3D Motion Planning
In this project, we've got a chance to apply what we've learned about 3D motion planning from the Planning section classes to plan and execute a mission in a complex urban environment!

Building a Controller
In this project, we've implemented a controller for a quadrotor in C++. Experimented on building PID Controller and 3D Dynamics of a quadcopter.

Building an Estimator
In this project we've implemented an estimator to track the position and attitude of a quadrotor moving in three dimensions. Experimented on Kalman Filters Estimation and Localization.
